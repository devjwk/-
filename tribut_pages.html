                        the first son of An Tae-hun (안태훈; 安泰勳) and Jo Maria
                        (Jo Seong-nyeo 조성녀; 趙姓女), of the family of the Sunheung-An 
                        (순흥안씨; 順興安氏) lineage. His childhood name was An Eung-chil
                         (안응칠; 安應七; [anɯŋtɕʰil]).<br><br> As a boy, he learned Chinese literature 
                         and Western sciences, but was more interested in martial arts and 
                         marksmanship. Kim Gu (김구; 金九), future leader of the Korean independence
                          movement who had taken refuge in An Tae-hun's house at the time, wrote 
                          that young An Jung-geun was an excellent marksman, liked to read books, 
                          and had strong charisma.
